<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>Effective date: June 29, 2020</p>
<p>
   We at WOLF know you care about how your personal information is used
   and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the
   following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By using or
   accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept
   the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you
   hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information
   in the following ways.
</p>
<p>
   Remember that your use of WOLF’s Services is at all times subject to
   our Terms of Use, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we
   use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to
   them in the Terms of Use.
</p>
<p>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</p>
<p>
   This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable
   information (‘Personal Data’) that we gather when you are accessing or
   using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own
   or control, or people that we don’t manage. We gather various types of
   Personal Data from our users, as explained in more detail below, and
   we use this Personal Data in connection with our products and
   services, including to develop, offer, operate, personalize, provide,
   and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account and
   profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to
   fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to
   analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share
   some Personal Data with third parties as described below.
</p>
<p>
   What Personal Data does WOLF collect?
</p>
<p>
   We collect Personal Data about you when you provide such information
   directly to us, when third parties such as our business partners or
   service providers provide us with Personal Data about you, or when
   Personal Data about you is automatically collected in connection with
   your use of our Services.
</p>

   We receive and store any information you provide to us. For example,
   through the registration process and/or through your account settings,
   we may collect Personal Data such as the following:

   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   Please note that certain information may be required to register with
   us or to take advantage of some of our features.
</p>
<p>Information Collected Automatically:</p>
<p>
   Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and
   record information on our server logs from your browser or device,
   which may include the following:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>IP address </li>
   <li>
      Device identifiers and information
   </li>
   <li>Web browser information</li>
   <li>Page view statistics </li>
   <li>Browsing history </li>
   <li>Usage information </li>
   <li>
      Transaction information (e.g. transaction amount, date and time such
      transaction occurred)
   </li>
   <li>
      Cookies and certain other tracking technologies (e.g. web beacons,
      pixel tags, SDKs, etc.). For more information, see below.
   </li>
   <li>
      Location information (e.g. IP address, zip code), including
      geolocation/GPS data. For more information, see below.
   </li>
   <li>
      Log data (e.g. access times, hardware and software information)
   </li>
</ul>
<p>Geolocation Data:</p>
<p>
   If you are accessing the Services from a mobile device or through a
   mobile application, you may be asked to share your precise geolocation
   information with us so we can customize your experience on the
   Services. We will ask you to opt-in before we use geolocation
   information to identify your precise location. If you agree to such
   collection, in most cases, you will be able to turn off such data
   collection at any time by accessing the privacy settings of your
   mobile device and/or through the settings in our mobile application.
</p>
<p>
   Additional Information about Cookies:
</p>
<p>
   The Services use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags,
   web beacons, clear GIFs, and JavaScript (collectively, ‘Cookies’) to
   enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and
   when you visit and use our Services, to analyze trends, learn about
   our user base and operate and improve our Services. Cookies are small
   files, usually consisting of letters and numbers placed on your
   computer, tablet, phone, or similar device when you use that device to
   visit our Services. We sometimes combine information collected through
   Cookies that is not Personal Data with Personal Data that we have
   about you, for example, to tell us who you are or whether you have an
   account with us. We may also supplement the information we collect
   from you with information received from third parties.
</p>
<p>
   Cookies can either be ‘session Cookies’ or ‘persistent Cookie’.
   Session Cookies are temporary Cookies that are stored on your device
   while you are visiting or using our Services, whereas ‘persistent
   Cookies’ are stored on your device for a period of time after you
   leave our Services. The length of time a persistent Cookie stays on
   your device varies from Cookie to Cookie. We use persistent Cookies to
   store your preferences so that they are available for the next visit,
   and to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit our
   Services, how often you return, how your use of the Services may vary
   over time. We also use persistent Cookies to measure the effectiveness
   of advertising efforts. Through these Cookies, we may collect
   information about your online activity after you leave our Services.
   Your browser may offer you a ‘Do Not Track’ or ‘DNT’ option, which
   allows you to signal to operators of websites, and web applications,
   and services that you do not wish such operators to track certain of
   your online activities over time and across different websites.
   Because we collect browsing and persistent identifier data, the
   Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which
   means that we may collect information about your online activity both
   while you are using the Services and after you leave our properties.
</p>
<p>
   Some Cookies are placed by a third party on your device and may
   provide information to us and third parties about your browsing habits
   (such as your visits to our Services, the pages you have visited and
   the links and advertisements you have clicked). These Cookies can be
   used to determine whether certain third party services are being used,
   to identify your interests, to retarget advertisements to you and to
   serve advertisements to you that we or others believe are relevant to
   you. We do not control third party Cookies.
</p>
<p>
   We use the following types of Cookies:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      Essential Cookies. Essential Cookies are required for providing you
      with features or services that you have requested. For example,
      certain Cookies enable you to log into secure areas of our Services.
      Disabling these Cookies may make certain features and services
      unavailable.
   </li>
   <li>
      Functional Cookies. Functional Cookies are used to record your
      choices and settings regarding our Services, maintain your preferences
      over time and recognize you when you return to our Services. These
      Cookies help us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name,
      and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or
      region).
   </li>
   <li>
      Performance/Analytical Cookies. Performance/Analytical Cookies allow
      us to understand how visitors use our Services such as by collecting
      information about the number of visitors to the Services, what pages
      visitors view on our Services and how long visitors are viewing pages
      on the Services. Performance/Analytical Cookies also help us measure
      the performance of our advertising campaigns in order to help us
      improve our campaigns and the Services’ content for those who engage
      with our advertising. For example, Google, Inc. (‘Google’) uses
      cookies in connection with its Google Analytics services. Google’s
      ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics
      about your visits to the Services is subject to the Google Analytics
      Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You have the option to opt
      out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising
      opt-out page at www.google.com/privacy_ads.html or the Google
      Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on at
      https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.
   </li>
   <li>
      Retargeting/Advertising Cookies.Retargeting/Advertising Cookies
      collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so
      that we can provide advertising that we believe is relevant to you.
      For more information about this, please see the section below titled
      ‘Additional information about Interest-Based Advertisements.’
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   You can decide whether or not to accept Cookies. One way you can do
   this is through your internet browser’s settings. Most browsers have
   an option for turning off the Cookie feature, which will prevent your
   browser from accepting new Cookies, as well as (depending on the
   sophistication of your browser software) allow you to decide on
   acceptance of each new Cookie in a variety of ways. You can also
   delete all Cookies that are already on your computer. If you do this,
   however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time
   you visit a site and some Services and functionalities may not work.
</p>
<p>
   To explore what Cookie setting are available to you, look in the
   ‘preferences’ or ‘options’ section of your browser’s menu. To find out
   more information about Cookies, including information about how to
   manage and delete Cookies, please visit
   http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.
</p>
<p>
   Additional Information about Interest-Based Advertisements:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      We may serve advertisements, and also allow third party ad networks,
      including third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors
      and research firms, to serve advertisements through the Services.
      These advertisements may be targeted to users who fit certain general
      profile categories or display certain preferences or behaviors
      (‘Interest-Based Ads’). Information for Internet-Based Ads (including
      Personal Data) may be provided to us by you, or derived from the usage
      patterns of particular users on the Services and/or services of Third
      Parties. Such information may be gathered through tracking users’
      activities across time and unaffiliated properties. To accomplish
      this, we or our service providers may deliver Cookies, including a
      file (known as a ‘web beacon’) from an ad network to you through the
      Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized,
      aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for
      advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted
      advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Web beacons allow
      ad networks to view, edit or set their own Cookies on your browser,
      just as if you had requested a web page from their site.
   </li>
   <li>
      Through the Digital Advertising Alliance (‘DAA’) and Network
      Advertising Initiative (‘NAI’), several media and marketing
      associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to
      give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over ads
      that are customized based on their online behavior across different
      websites. To make choices about Interest-Based Ads from participating
      third parties, including to opt out of receiving behaviorally targeted
      advertisements from participating organizations, please visit the
      DAA’s or NAI’s consumer opt out pages.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   Information We Receive From Third Party Sources
</p>
<p>
   Some third parties such as our business partners and service providers
   provide us with Personal Data about you, such as the following:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      Information from our service providers: We receive information
      collected by third parties about your use of the Services. For
      example, we may use analytics service providers to analyze how you
      interact and engage with the Services and our advertisements, so we
      can learn and make enhancements to offer you a better experience. Some
      of these entities may use Cookies, web beacons and other technologies
      to collect information about your use of the Services and other
      websites, which may include tracking activity across time and
      unaffiliated properties, including your IP address, web browser, pages
      viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information.
      Third parties may also help us provide you with customer support and
      provide us with information so that we may help you use our Services.
   </li>
   <li>
      Account information for third party services: If you provide your
      third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the
      Services through a third party site or service, you understand some
      content and/or information in those accounts (‘Third Party Account
      Information’) may be transmitted into your account with us if you
      authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information
      transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy; for
      example, information from your public profile, if the third party
      service and your account settings allow such sharing. The information
      we receive will depend on the policies and your account settings with
      the third-party service.
   </li>
   <li>
      Information from our advertising partners: We receive information
      about you from some of our service providers who assist us with
      marketing or promotional services related to how you interact with our
      websites, applications, products, services, advertisements or
      communications.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>How do we use your Personal Data?</p>
<p>
   We process Personal Data to develop, operate, improve, understand, and
   personalize our Services. For example, we use Personal Data to:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      Communicate with you about the Services, including Service
      announcements, updates or offers Provide support and assistance for
      the Services
   </li>
   <li>
      Personalize website content and communications based on your
      preferences
   </li>
   <li>
      Recommend products and services that we think may be of interest to
      you
   </li>
   <li>Create and manage user profiles</li>
   <li>Process orders </li>
   <li>Respond to user inquiries </li>
   <li>Fulfill user requests </li>
   <li>
      Comply with our legal or contractual obligations
   </li>
   <li>Resolve disputes </li>
   <li>
      Protect against or deter fraudulent, illegal, or harmful actions
   </li>
</ul>
<p>Enforce our Terms of Use</p>
<p>
   As noted above, we may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the
   means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we
   may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses or
   email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a
   confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps
   us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our
   services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please
   indicate your preference by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@wolf.financial">support@wolf.financial</a>.
</p>
<p>
   What about non-personally identifiable data?
</p>
<p>
   In addition to processing your Personal Data as set forth herein, we
   may also de-identify or aggregate your Personal Data to create data
   that does not specifically identified you as an individual
   (‘Non-PII’). We use Non-PII for various business purposes, which may
   include incorporating Non-PII in our current or future products and
   services, selling Non-PII to our customers or business partners or
   providing Non-PII to our business partners for their use in connection
   with their own products or services. For example, we may provide
   aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to
   collect that information from you), who may use such information to
   understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that
   they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However,
   we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a
   partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner
   that would identify you as an individual person.
</p>
<p>
   Will WOLF share any of the Personal Data it receives?
</p>
<p>
   We may share your Personal Data with third parties as described in
   this section:
</p>
<p>Service Providers</p>
<p>
   We share Personal Data with vendors and third party service providers
   who work on our behalf and provide us with services related to the
   purposes described in this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use. These
   parties may include:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Ad networks</li>
   <li>
      Fraud prevention service providers
   </li>
   <li>Analytics service providers </li>
   <li>
      Staff augmentation and contract personnel
   </li>
   <li>Hosting service providers </li>
   <li>Co-location service providers </li>
   <li>
      Telecommunications service providers
   </li>
</ul>
<p>Data providers and vendors</p>
<p>
   Unless we tell you differently, our vendors and service providers do
   not have any right to use the Personal Data we share with them beyond
   what is necessary to assist us.
</p>
<p>Affiliated Businesses </p>
<p>
   In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re
   affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you
   through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly
   with us). We have no control over the policies and practices of third
   party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you
   choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an
   affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or
   websites’ policies.
</p>
<p>Data Shared at Your Request</p>
<p>
   We also share Personal Data when necessary to complete a transaction
   initiated or authorized by you or provide you with a product or
   service you have requested. In addition to those set forth above,
   these parties also include:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      Other users (where you post information publicly or as otherwise
      necessary to affect a transaction initiated or authorized by you
      through the Services)
   </li>
   <li>
      Social media services (if you interact with them through your use of
      the Services)
   </li>
   <li>
      Third party business partners who you access through the Services
   </li>
   <li>Data providers and vendors</li>
   <li>Other parties authorized by you</li>
</ul>
<p>User Profiles and Submissions</p>
<p>
   Certain user profile information that such user has uploaded to the
   Services, including your name, location, video or image content and
   Stock Tracking Information, may be displayed to other users to
   facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your
   request for our services. Your account privacy settings may allow you
   to limit the other users who can see the Personal Data in your user
   profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to
   others. Please remember that any content you upload to your public
   user profile, along with any Personal Data or content that you
   voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on
   discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly
   available, and can be collected and used by anyone. Your full name and
   WOLF username may also be displayed to other users if and when you
   send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the
   Services and other users can contact you through messages and
   comments. Additionally, if you sign into the Services through a third
   party social networking site or service, your list of ‘friends’ from
   that site or service may be automatically imported to the Services,
   and such ‘friends,’ if they are also registered users of the Services,
   may be able to access certain non-public information you have entered
   in your Services user profile. Again, we do not control the policies
   and practices of any other third party site or service.
</p>
<p>Business Transfers</p>
<p>
   We may choose to buy or sell assets and may share and/or transfer
   customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry
   into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or
   if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other
   change of control, Personal Data could be one of the assets
   transferred to or acquired by a third party.
</p>
<p>Protection of Company and Others</p>
<p>
   We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any
   information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court
   order; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or
   protect the rights, property, or safety of Company, our employees, our
   users, or others.
</p>
<p>Is Personal Data about me secure?</p>
<p>
   Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security.
   If you access your account via a third party site or service, you may
   have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party
   site or service. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account
   and Personal Data by selecting and protecting your password and/or
   other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your
   computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished
   accessing your account.
</p>
<p>
   We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal
   Data that we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot
   guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or
   software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of
   user information at any time.
</p>
<p>
   How long do we retain your Personal Data?
</p>
<p>
   We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open
   account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you Services. In
   some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is
   necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or
   collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable
   law, rule, or regulation or our policies (including without limitation
   this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service). Afterwards, we retain
   some information in a depersonalized or aggregated form but not in a
   way that would identify you personally.
</p>
<p>What Personal Data can I access?</p>
<p>
   Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases,
   edit or delete the following information you’ve provided to us
   (provided that we may retain a backup copy for continued use in
   accordance with this Privacy Policy):
</p>

      and posts you submit publicly, photographs you upload, etc.), which
      can include Personal Data if you include Personal Data in such content
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the
   Services change. If you have any questions about viewing or updating
   information we have on file about you, please contact us at
   <a href="mailto:support@wolf.financial">support@wolf.financial</a>.
</p>
<p>What choices do I have?</p>

   Will WOLF ever change this Privacy Policy?
</p>
<p>
   We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to
   change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will
   alert you to changes by placing a notice on the website, by sending
   you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve
   opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t
   provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still
   govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for
   reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any
   changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree
   to all of the changes. Use of information we collect now is subject to
   the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.
